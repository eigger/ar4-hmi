## ⚙️ Setup & Running from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Annin-Robotics/ar4-hmi.git
cd ar4-hmi/Control\ Software

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the control interface
python AR4.py

## 🧠 Troubleshooting
- **Serial connection issues** → Verify correct COM port and Teensy 4.1 firmware version ≥ 6.3.  
- **Display lag in visualization** → Disable real-time rendering under *Settings → Viewer Options*.
